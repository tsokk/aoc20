# Advent of Code 2020
You'll find here some C++ code that solves puzzles. These are not all easy to
solve. Considerable effort goes into cracking the mode difficult ones. Also,
programming has its own complications. As do installing and maintaining the
tools needed to write and compile the code.

I would like to focus on these problems and their solutions. And to minimize
energy used on thinking about other things. This means I would like to find a
a minimun set of tools to build this code on computers and operating systems
that I have. Here's a list of things that I need for this purpose:

* compiler: [Clang](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)
* debugger: [LLDB](http://lldb.llvm.org/)
* version control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* easy sharing between computers: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).

I spent some time studying CMake, but came to the conclusion that including it
would add to the complications mentioned. I may add it later, if its expected
benefits outweigh the costs of adding, configuring, and maintaining it.
